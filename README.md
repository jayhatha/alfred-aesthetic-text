# alfred-aesthetic-text
Make that text ａｅｓｔｈｅｔｉｃ using full-width Japanese characters.

HOW TO USE
-----
1) download workflow, add to Alfred by double-clicking
2) select text, hit cmd-opt-F, text becomes ＦＵＬＬＷＩＤＴＨ ＡＥＳＴＨＥＴＩＣ.

CREDITS
-----
Based on an idea by [SebastianAigner](https://github.com/SebastianAigner/alfred-fullwidth), but I replaced the Python script with a Ruby one now that Apple has deprecated /usr/bin/python in Mac OS 12.3. 

NOTES
-----
The Ruby script is pretty hacky and only works with the 26 alphabetic characters. May improve it in the future to achieve parity with the Python version.
